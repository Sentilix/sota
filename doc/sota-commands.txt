SotA - State of the Art
=======================

- The next step in DKP!


What is SotA?
SotA is an addon to manage DKP for the guild. The DKP for each player is stored in the public guild notes or officer notes, and can thereby be exported via addons such as RPGO_GuildProfiler.

The overall functionality of SotA can be divided into four main categories: DKP handling, Item Auctions, Raid Queue and Logging.

Read the ReadMe.txt for full command line interface.
Here are the most important ones:
