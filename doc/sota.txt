SotA - State of the Art

Roadmap:
0.7	Renamed to SOTA
0.7.1:
- First tested release by Sota

0.7.2:
- Fixed UNDO transaction
- People can now be removed from raid queue

0.8	Add Config screen for Boss/Instance DKP, configure bid timer
0.8.0:
- Added 3 config panes: Auction, Boss DKP, Misc DKP
0.8.1:
- Added support for minimum DKP (using boss dkp)
- Added zone detection (missing a few ones, like Cthun and KelThuzad)
0.8.2:
- Added support for "/sota share" which shares the current Boss DKP across raid.
0.9	Add Dashboard


Known issues:
- Check the Public/Officer note status; it might be reversed!!
- And could you change that when someone whispers for queue like "queue healer" it wouldnt matter if the first letter is capital Q?
- Seems sync of commands is somewhat broken? Test ...
- Removal of bids does not reset minimum bid
New features:
- Add OS option ("/w sota os 200" to do an OS bid)
- "/sota queue" must return more detailed queue information (3 tanks, 2 healers in queue)





Wishlist:

- RaidQueue: (Janitor) Add a list of (lvl 60) players not in raid
- AuctionUI: Add a CLOSE button, available for non-ML ("Spectators")
