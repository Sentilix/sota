- [Feature 1.2.0-3] Added: Rank rule engine (how the fuck do we do this?)
- [Feature] See who is in range (a border box? bg colour?)
BUGS:
- Clicking a Config button resets the current window position


Feature details:
----------------
[Feature 1.2.0-1] Configurable raid messages:
- Identify all raid messages
	"Auction open for %s"
	"/w %s bid <your bid>"
	"Minimum bid: %d DKP"
	"10 seconds left for %s"
	"/w %s bid <your bid>"
	"3 seconds left"
	"2 seconds left"
	"1 second left"
- Create UI for all Auction messages:


[Feature 1.2.0-2] Configurable message channels
- Add options for [Raid], [RW], [Yell], [Say], [Guild] (more?)
- Remove SOTA_CONFIG_OutputChannel setting (obsolete)


[Feature 1.2.0-3] Rank rule engine (how the fuck do we do this?)
- Design a rule engine.
- Create UI to fit the design.
- Implement rule engine


[Feature 1.2.0-4] Sync button for Sync common config settings
- Identify settings to be sync'ed
- Create UI for sync'ing (show people with SotA in raid + version of Sota + version of Sync)
- Implement sync'ing, including some kind of version id + name of "owner" (last person to change settings)



Backlog:
- Added: Add dkp outside raid and do "bulk commits" (for guild donations)
- Bugfix: "you are not in the guild" bug when joining queue (often straight after logon).
	* I might not be able to do anything about this, since the API is providing wrong info!
Known issues:
- Boss DKP values are not persisted (unable to reproduce)
New features:
- Auction contains a "Minimum Bid" field (needs a LAUCH button also?)
- Make whispers configurable
Wishlist:
- RaidQueue: (Janitor) Add a list of (lvl 60) players not in raid
- AuctionUI: Add a CLOSE button, available for non-ML ("Spectators")
- context menu!
